	<h3>Site Terms and Conditions of Use</h3>

	<p>Hello everyone! Welcome to Project Starborn! I'm happy to have you here, and I hope you feel the same way! As per legal requirements, we must have a set of rules that we expect everyone to obey in order to maintain peace on the site. Because based on our laws, it can't appear to be done with common sense alone. In the main section of this TOS you'll likely be bored with all the lawyer-like details that our society seems to expect, despite how pointless and redundant it is, but of course we must do it for legal reasons. After all, we need to take those silly men in suits VERY seriously.</p>

	<p>Before we do that, however, I'd like to take the opportunity to address those of you who are happy to address things intelligently. If you're a responsible person who is using this site to enjoy our services, we're overjoyed to have you here. If it seems beyond your comprehension to handle the ridiculously simple task of being nice to people and working cooperatively with us, we'd like to ask you to refrain from using this site so that the people who actually have a dab of willpower can enjoy themselves.</p>

	<p>I'd also like to quickly address the jurers of the world. It's easy to tell that the vast majority of legal issues are caused by the emotionally unhealthy minority of individuals with unrealistic expectations. Generally, something that could be easily solved is instead blown way out of proportion, and misleading tactics are used to make it sound more important than it really is. So some lawyer guy trained in the art of manipulation and who knows more about law than the people programming a nice site for the pleasant enjoyment of humankind steps in and is more than willing to ruin those people's lives in exchange for a fortune at their expense. So if for some insane reason this site actually gets involved with legal matters, I'd like to remind you that laywers are trained in the art of manipulation and brainwashing. You should be able to spot it in court, because it's about the only thing that happens. I mean, let's face it - handing out money to immature people just perpetuates the ridiculous problems with our system without actually solving the issue supposedly at hand.</p>

	<p>To therefore make this very simple, by using this site you are agreeing that at any given moment, any law that I feel should apply or applies at the times of my choosing - does. You have voluntarily agreed to those terms by registering at this site. Also, there is absoultely no responsibility taken from this site for ANYTHING that happens here. So if you're offended by something, whoopidy doo. We're not going to treat everyone on our site like five year olds. We respect that there are practical limits (and we will be practical), but we'd like to defend our user's right to have some fun on the internet without having to worry about all sorts of restrictions. If society is okay with the media and movies showing five-year olds violence, hatred, murder, gore, and torture, or spreading hatred on the news, then this site is the least of your worries.</p>

	<p>You must be over the age of 13 to join this site. Why? Because certain politicians apparently decided there was a dire need for children under the age of 13 to be sheltered from the world. If you are underage and have legal guardians, you need to get their permission to join the site. You also need to tell your legal guardians what this site is about, the fact that it is very awesome, and everything you do on this site. You cannot hide what you're doing on this site (EVER) from your legal guardians (again, this is for legal purposes). If you have hidden anything from your legal guardians, you are breaking the Terms of Service, and we will hold you accountable to the full extent of the law (or, more realistically, I'll it to protect myself, because I personally care about such trivial matters). It is your legal guardian's responsibility to ensure that you are not doing anything inappropriate with the use of this site. If you do something inappropriate or illegal, both you and your legal guardians will be held responsible.</p>

	<p>Suffice to say, if anything "bad" happens while you are on this site ("bad" in this case refers to anything is unfortunate enough that you or your legal guardians feel the need to bring it to the attention of anyone but yourself), you are unable to hold anyone accountable but yourself and your legal guardians. If you do attempt to hold somebody accountable or ever attempt to sue us, you agree that you a terrible person that deserves to lose in court. By joining our site, that agreement is made fully binding. If you do not agree to those terms, do not register at this site or use it in any way.</p>

	<p>Okay, there... now we can get to all that boring, misguided legal jargon that's tearing our world apart. Horray! But before we do that, let's recap: Project Starborn is awesome. You're awesome. And can we all get along together. If you don't think that's the case, you should leave now and pretend that Project Starborn and unicorns don't exist. Even though it's possible that they are real (that's what she said).</p>
